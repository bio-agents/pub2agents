Pub2Agents documentation
#######################

Pub2Agents is a Java command-line agent that looks through the scientific literature available in `Europe PMC <https://europepmc.org/>`_ and constructs entry candidates for the `bio.agents <https://bio.agents/>`_ software registry from suitable publications. It automates a lot of the process needed for growing bio.agents, though results of the agent still need some manual curation before they are of satisfactory quality. Pub2Agents could be run at the beginning of each month to add hundreds of agents, databases and services published in bioinformatics and life sciences journals during the previous month.
